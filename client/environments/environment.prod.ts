// The file contents for the current environment will overwrite these during build.
// The scripts/setenv.js script is used to generate an environment file with the variables found in the .env file.
// The build system defaults to the dev environment which uses `environment.ts`, but if you do
// `ng build --env=prod` then `environment.prod.ts` will be used instead.
